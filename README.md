# **Permisions**

**Warpbeat Permissions Explained**

To give you the best fitness tracking experience, Warpbeat needs access to certain features and data on your device. We only ask for permissions essential for the app to work correctly. Here‚Äôs what we need and why:

**1. Bluetooth (Essential for Sensors)**

*   **Permissions:** `Nearby devices` (includes Scanning & Connecting)
*   **Why:** This is crucial for finding and connecting to your Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) heart rate monitors, foot pods, or other fitness sensors. Without this, the app can't get real-time data like your heart rate during workouts.
    *   *(Technical Note: On newer Android versions, this requires separate `BLUETOOTH_SCAN` and `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` permissions. Older versions might just ask for general Bluetooth access.)*

**2. Location (Essential for GPS Tracking & Sensor Discovery)**

*   **Permissions:** `Precise location` (GPS), potentially `Approximate location`
*   **Why:**
    *   **Workout Routes:** To accurately track your distance, speed, and map your route for activities like running, cycling, or walking using GPS.
    *   **Finding Bluetooth Sensors:** Android requires Location access to scan for nearby Bluetooth Low Energy devices. **Even if you don't need a GPS map for your workout type, this permission is often necessary just to find your sensors.**
*   **Recommendation:** Choose "**Allow only while using the app**" for the best balance of functionality and privacy.

**3. Foreground Service & Background Operation (Essential for Continuous Tracking)**

*   **Permissions:** `Physical activity` / `Health data`, `Connected devices`, `Location` (for background use notifications)
*   **Why:** When you start a workout and then switch apps or turn off your screen, Warpbeat needs to keep running in the background to continuously record your sensor data (heart rate, etc.) and location (if applicable). The "Foreground Service" permission allows this, usually showing a persistent notification so you know it's active and Android doesn't shut it down prematurely. The specific types (`connectedDevice`, `health`, `location`) tell Android exactly *why* the service is running.

**4. Body Sensors (Optional - Depending on App Features)**

*   **Permissions:** `Body sensors` / `Health data`
*   **Why:** This permission is for accessing sensors *built directly into your phone or smartwatch* (like a built-in heart rate monitor on a watch). If Warpbeat only connects to *external* Bluetooth sensors, you might not need to grant this specific permission unless the app also utilizes on-device sensors.
*   **Background Sensors:** The `BODY_SENSORS_BACKGROUND` permission would be needed if the app accesses these *on-device* sensors while running in the background.

**5. Network Access**

*   **Permissions:** `Network access` / `Internet`
*   **Why:** Allows Warpbeat to potentially sync your workout data with an online account, check for updates, or download other necessary information. This is usually granted automatically.

**How Permissions Are Requested:**

Android will ask for your permission via pop-up dialogs the first time Warpbeat needs to use a specific feature (like starting Bluetooth scanning or accessing location).

**Managing Your Permissions:**

You can review and change the permissions granted to Warpbeat at any time in your device's settings:

*   Go to `Settings` > `Apps` > `Warpbeat` > `Permissions`.

**Our Commitment:**

We only request permissions that are necessary for Warpbeat's features to function correctly. We value your privacy and data security.
